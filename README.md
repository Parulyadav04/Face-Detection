This is aa face detection model implemented using Python and OpenCV with the help of site package named haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml present in OpenCV lib.
In this the color of the image is first changed from BGR2GRAY as it is easier to find face muscles in gray color and thus makes it easy to box the detected face and then this it is again changed into its original color.
From code we can see that to stop the camera I have used letter "p" as waitKey, you can use any letter to do the same
